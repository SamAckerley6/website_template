## 🛠️ How to Edit Text in HTML

1. **Open Your HTML File**  
   Open the `.html` file you want to edit in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VSCode, or any code editor).  

2. **Find the Text You Want to Change**  
   Look for content between `<tag>` and `</tag>` (e.g., `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`). The text you want to edit is between these tags.

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   For example changing text is shown here:
   
```html
<h1>Old Text</h1>

<h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
```
   
4. **Save the file (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S) and refresh your browser to see the changes.**

## 🔍 Where to Find the Code You Want to Edit

1.  **Use Your Browser’s Developer Tools**
		• Right-click anywhere on the webpage and select Inspect (or press F12).
		• Hover over the elements in the developer tools to highlight the corresponding parts of the webpage.
2.  **Search Your HTML File**
                • Use the search feature in your text editor (Ctrl + F or Cmd + F) to find specific text or elements.
3.  **Look for Comments**
 
HTML files often include comments like:

```html
<!-- This is the navigation section -->
```

_These comments can help you identify where specific sections of the webpage are located in the code._
